# Sitepack
A toolkit for building lazymorphic applications.


## What is [lazymorphic applications](https://blog.andyet.com/2015/05/18/lazymorphic-apps-bringing-back-static-web)?
TL;DR
> Pre-rendered Single Page Applications.


## Why lazymorphic?
Static + SPA + SEO.


## Why not Universal/Isomorphic?
- Universal apps need to run in the Node context, they are hard to build, take more time and effort, and more bugs to deal with (some come from server side, not IE, damn...).
- Running a Node.js server is not simple, more cost, more (security) issues, more uncertainties.
- Cache is hard.


## Features
- Powered by [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), you can add [loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/list-of-loaders.html) like Typescript, Babel, Jade, React, SASS, LESS, Post CSS, Markdown, ...
- Support [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules).
- Load content, scripts and style on demand.
- Client side routing.
- Pre-rendered at build time.
